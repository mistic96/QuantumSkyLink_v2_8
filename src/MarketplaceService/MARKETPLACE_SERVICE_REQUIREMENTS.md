**Definition**: Simple, direct pricing where seller sets one price for their tokens.
- **Use Case**: Standard "Buy It Now" style listings
- **Implementation**: Single price field, immediate purchase
- **Best For**: Simple transactions, clear pricing

### **2. Bulk Pricing** üì¶
**Definition**: "Take it all" pricing - buyer must purchase the entire listing quantity for the set price.
- **Business Logic**: All-or-nothing purchase requirement
- **Example**: 1,000 tokens for $50,000 total (cannot buy 500 for $25,000)
- **Use Case**: Liquidating entire positions, wholesale transactions
- **Implementation**: Single total price for complete inventory

### **3. Margin-Based Pricing** üìà
**Definition**: Dynamic pricing that automatically adjusts based on current market price plus a fixed margin.

#### **Fixed Dollar Margin**

- **Market Price $150** ‚Üí **Sell Price $170**

#### **Percentage Margin**
- **Example**: Asset always sells for 5% above current market price
- **Market Price $100** ‚Üí **Sell Price $105**
- **Market Price $150** ‚Üí **Sell Price $157.50**

### **4. Tiered Pricing** üéØ
**Definition**: Different prices for different quantity ranges.
- **Example**: 1-10 tokens = $100 each, 11-50 tokens = $95 each
- **Use Case**: Encouraging larger purchases with volume discounts
- **Implementation**: Quantity-based price tiers

### **5. Dynamic Pricing** ‚ö°
**Definition**: Price changes based on real-time market conditions.
- **Factors**: Demand, supply, market trends, trading volume
- **Implementation**: Real-time price adjustments based on market data
- **Use Case**: Sophisticated traders, market-responsive pricing

### **6. Unit Pricing** üî¢
**Definition**: Standard per-token pricing model.
- **Implementation**: Clear cost per individual token
- **Use Case**: Transparent, straightforward pricing
