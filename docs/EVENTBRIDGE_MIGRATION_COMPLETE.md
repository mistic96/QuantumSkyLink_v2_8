# EventBridge Migration - Implementation Complete

## Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

The immediate replacement of RabbitMQ with AWS EventBridge has been completed as requested. All services have been migrated to use EventBridge for event-driven communication.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ CloudFormation Template
**File**: `infra/aws/aws-eventbridge-messaging.template.json`
- 5 Event Buses (core, financial, blockchain, business, system)
- 8 SQS Queues with Dead Letter Queues
- 3 FIFO queues for financial services
- SNS Topics for notifications
- Event rules for routing

### 2. ✅ Event Bus Abstraction
**File**: `src/QuantumSkyLink.Shared/Eventing/IEventBus.cs`
- Interface for event publishing
- DomainEvent base class
- Support for both EventBridge and RabbitMQ (future compatibility)

### 3. ✅ EventBridge Implementation
**File**: `src/QuantumSkyLink.Shared/Eventing/EventBridgeEventBus.cs`
- AWS SDK integration
- Automatic bus routing based on event type
- Correlation ID support
- Error handling and retry logic

### 4. ✅ SQS Consumer Service
**File**: `src/QuantumSkyLink.Shared/Eventing/SQSConsumerService.cs`
- Background service for message consumption
- Event type registration
- Handler invocation pattern
- Automatic message deletion after processing

### 5. ✅ AppHost Configuration Updated
**File**: `QuantunSkyLink_v2.AppHost/AppHost.cs`
- Removed RabbitMQ references from all 7 services
- Added EventBridge CloudFormation stack
- Configured SQS queue URLs for each service
- Added EventBridge feature flags

### 6. ✅ LocalStack Testing Infrastructure
**Files Created**:
- `docker-compose.localstack.yml` - LocalStack container configuration
- `scripts/deploy-localstack.sh` - Linux/Mac deployment script
- `scripts/deploy-localstack.ps1` - Windows deployment script
- `scripts/start-localstack-test.sh` - Complete testing orchestration
- `appsettings.LocalStack.json` - LocalStack-specific configuration

## Services Migrated

All 7 services that previously used RabbitMQ have been migrated:

| Service | Queue Type | Queue Name |
|---------|------------|------------|
| ComplianceService | Standard | qsl-{env}-compliance-inbox |
| GovernanceService | Standard | qsl-{env}-governance-inbox |
| PaymentGatewayService | FIFO | qsl-{env}-paymentgateway-inbox.fifo |
| LiquidationService | FIFO | qsl-{env}-liquidation-inbox.fifo |
| AIReviewService | Standard | qsl-{env}-aireview-inbox |
| NotificationService | Standard | qsl-{env}-notification-inbox |
| QuantumLedgerHub | Standard | qsl-{env}-quantumledger-inbox |

---

## Testing with LocalStack

### Quick Start (2-5 minutes)

1. **Start LocalStack and Deploy**:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   chmod +x scripts/start-localstack-test.sh
   ./scripts/start-localstack-test.sh
   
   # Windows PowerShell
   .\scripts\deploy-localstack.ps1
   ```

2. **The script will automatically**:
   - Start LocalStack container
   - Deploy EventBridge infrastructure
   - Run smoke tests
   - Start the application

### Manual Testing

1. **Start LocalStack**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.localstack.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   ./scripts/deploy-localstack.sh
   
   # Windows
   powershell .\scripts\deploy-localstack.ps1
   ```

3. **Run Application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project QuantunSkyLink_v2.AppHost
   ```

4. **Test Event Publishing**:
   ```bash
   aws events put-events \
     --entries '[{"Source":"qsl.test","DetailType":"Test.Event","Detail":"{\"test\":true}"}]' \
     --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 \
     --region us-east-1
   ```

---

## Configuration

### For LocalStack Testing
Use `appsettings.LocalStack.json` or set environment:
```bash
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=LocalStack
```

### For AWS Deployment
Update `appsettings.json` with AWS credentials and endpoints:
```json
{
  "AWS": {
    "EventBridge": {
      "Enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Time Estimates

| Phase | Time | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| LocalStack Setup | 5 minutes | ✅ Scripts ready |
| Infrastructure Deploy | 2 minutes | ✅ Automated |
| Smoke Testing | 5 minutes | ✅ Scripts included |
| Full Integration Test | 30 minutes | Ready to start |
| AWS Staging Deploy | 1 hour | After LocalStack success |

**Total Time to LocalStack Testing**: ~15 minutes
**Total Time to AWS Staging**: ~2 hours

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Testing** (Now):
   ```bash
   # Run this single command to test everything
   ./scripts/start-localstack-test.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Event Flow**:
   - Check LocalStack logs: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.localstack.yml logs -f`
   - Monitor SQS queues for messages
   - Verify EventBridge rules are triggering

3. **Deploy to AWS Staging** (After LocalStack Success):
   ```bash
   aspire deploy aws --environment staging
   ```

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, RabbitMQ can be restored by:
1. Reverting AppHost.cs changes
2. Uncommenting `var rabbitmq = builder.AddRabbitMQ("messaging");`
3. Re-adding `.WithReference(rabbitmq)` to services

---

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check LocalStack logs: `docker logs qsl-localstack`
- Review CloudFormation stack events in LocalStack
- Verify AWS credentials are set correctly
- Ensure Docker is running with sufficient resources

---

**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Ready for**: LocalStack Testing
**Time Required**: 15 minutes for local smoke test
**Next Action**: Run `./scripts/start-localstack-test.sh`
