# Technical White Paper: Implementing a High-Assurance, Zero-Trust Digital Signature Service

**Document Date**: June 13, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0  
**Status**: Final  
**Platform**: QuantumSkyLink v2

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture for a digital signature module that operates with the highest level of security and integrity. The initial design, where the signature module implicitly trusts a separate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) service, presents a significant security risk. A compromised MFA service or a man-in-the-middle attack could lead to forged signature approvals.

To mitigate this, we will adopt a Zero Trust architecture. This model shifts the "trust anchor" from an external service to the user's own hardware. We will leverage the FIDO2/WebAuthn standard to create a non-repudiable, cryptographic link between the user's biometric authentication and the specific transaction they are approving. The separate MFA service evolves into a critical Policy and Orchestration Engine, removed from the direct path of trust but essential for governance and auditing.

The recommended implementation utilizes ASP.NET Core on the backend with the fido2-net-lib library, and leverages native browser and mobile operating system APIs on the client-side. This approach ensures that what the user sees is what they sign (WYSIWYS), providing maximum assurance for all signature operations.

## 2. Introduction: The Security Challenge

The current design involves two separate services: a Signature Module and an MFA Service. The signature process relies on the MFA service to assert that a user has successfully authenticated.

**The Flaw**: The Signature Module must trust that the MFA service is honest and that its communication has not been tampered with. This implicit trust in another service is a critical vulnerability in a high-security workflow.

Our objective is to eliminate this implicit trust. The Signature Module should not trust any component it cannot independently, cryptographically verify.

---

## 3. The Zero-Trust Principle: Shifting the Trust Anchor

The core of our new architecture is to move away from trusting a service's attestation and toward trusting a cryptographic proof created by the user themselves.

The user's authentication action will trigger an on-device, hardware-backed private key to sign a data package containing the details of the transaction. This creates a non-repudiable, tamper-proof cryptographic proof that binds the user, the transaction, and user presence together, achieving the "What-You-See-Is-What-You-Sign" (WYSIWYS) principle.

---

## 4. Recommended Architecture: Transaction Binding with FIDO2/WebAuthn

FIDO2 and its corresponding web API, WebAuthn, are the modern, standardized technologies for achieving this flow. The primary workflow focuses on a direct, verifiable cryptographic exchange between the user's device and the Signature Module.

---

## 5. The Evolved Role of the MFA Service

While the MFA service is removed from the critical path of trust for the signature itself, it evolves into a vital Policy and Orchestration Engine. Its role becomes more sophisticated:

### Policy Enforcement Point
Before generating a challenge, the Signature Module consults the MFA service to enforce business rules: Is the user's account active? Is the request from a trusted device? Does the transaction value require a specific type of authenticator (e.g., a hardware key vs. a platform biometric)?

### Authentication Orchestrator
The service can manage the overall user journey, looking up a user's registered authenticators or providing legacy fallback options (e.g., OTP) for users on unsupported clients.

### Centralized Auditing and Logging
The MFA service becomes the central hub for logging all authentication attempts. The Signature Module reports the final success or failure of its cryptographic verification back to the MFA service to create a complete and unified audit trail for compliance and security monitoring.

### Credential Lifecycle Management
The service handles the user-facing workflows for registering new FIDO2 authenticators and revoking lost or compromised ones.

### Updated High-Level Signature Flow:

1. **Initiation**: A user requests to sign a document.
2. **Policy Check**: The Signature Module makes a call to the MFA Service: "User X wants to sign Transaction Y. Are there any policy violations?"
3. **Policy Decision**: The MFA Service checks its rules and responds "Proceed" or "Deny".
4. **Challenge Generation**: If approved, the Signature Module generates the challenge and transactionHash and sends them to the client.
5. **WebAuthn Flow**: The client executes the FIDO2/WebAuthn signing ceremony with the user's authenticator.
6. **Cryptographic Verification**: The client sends the resulting assertion back to the Signature Module, which performs the full cryptographic validation. This step is independent and does not trust the MFA service's earlier approval.
7. **Logging**: The Signature Module reports the final outcome (e.g., "Signature Verified") back to the MFA Service for centralized logging.
8. **Completion**: The signature process is complete.

## 6. Technology Stack & Implementation Guide

### 6.1. Backend (.NET)

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core (.NET 8+) is strongly recommended.
- **Core Library**: fido2-net-lib. This is the premier, .NET Foundation-supported library for FIDO2/WebAuthn server-side implementation.
- **For Legacy .NET Framework Systems**: The recommended approach is to build the FIDO2/WebAuthn logic as a separate ASP.NET Core microservice.

### 6.2. Client-Side (Web Applications)

- **Primary API**: The browser's native WebAuthn API (navigator.credentials.get()).
- **Recommended Helper Library**: @simplewebauthn/browser. This library simplifies interaction with the WebAuthn API.

### 6.3. Client-Side (Native & Cross-Platform Mobile Apps)

| Platform | Recommended Technology | Key Implementation Detail |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Native iOS | Local Authentication Framework | Use LAContext to invoke Face ID/Touch ID. The success should unlock a key stored in the Secure Enclave. |
| Native Android | BiometricPrompt API | Use BiometricPrompt. The operation must be tied to a cryptographic key stored in the Android Keystore System. |
| React Native | react-native-biometrics | A library that provides a JavaScript bridge to the native iOS and Android APIs. |
| Flutter | local_auth package | The official Flutter team package for accessing native biometric functionality. |

## 7. Security Guarantees of This Architecture

### Protection Against Rogue Services
A compromised MFA service cannot forge a signature approval, as it is not the root of trust.

### Strong Non-Repudiation
The use of a hardware-bound private key provides strong evidence that the specific user approved the specific transaction.

### Phishing Resistance
The WebAuthn standard includes origin binding, mitigating phishing attacks.

### End-to-End Integrity
The transaction data is cryptographically hashed and included in the signature, ensuring it cannot be altered after user approval.
