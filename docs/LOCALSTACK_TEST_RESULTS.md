# LocalStack Testing Results

## Date: 2025-09-05
## Status: Partial Success

---

## Summary

LocalStack has been successfully deployed and is running, but with limitations for EventBridge testing.

---

## Test Results

### ✅ Successful Components

1. **LocalStack Container**: Running successfully
   - Fixed volume mount issue by using named volumes instead of temp directory
   - Container healthy and accessible on port 4566
   - Services available: SQS, SNS, CloudFormation, IAM, CloudWatch, S3

2. **Docker Configuration**: Updated and working
   - Removed obsolete version attribute
   - Fixed volume permissions issue
   - Container networking established

### ⚠️ Limitations Found

1. **EventBridge Not Available**: 
   - The free version of LocalStack does not include EventBridge (events) service
   - This is a known limitation of LocalStack Community Edition
   - EventBridge requires LocalStack Pro license

2. **AWS CLI Not Installed**:
   - Need to install AWS CLI to run deployment scripts
   - Scripts are ready but require AWS CLI

---

## Available Services in LocalStack

```json
{
  "sqs": "available",
  "sns": "available", 
  "cloudformation": "available",
  "iam": "available",
  "cloudwatch": "available",
  "s3": "available",
  "events": "disabled"  // EventBridge not available in free version
}
```

## Next Steps

### Option 1: LocalStack Pro Trial
- Request LocalStack Pro trial license (14-day free trial)
- This would enable EventBridge testing locally
- URL: https://localstack.cloud/pricing/

### Option 2: Direct AWS Staging Deployment
- Skip local EventBridge testing
- Deploy directly to AWS staging environment
- Use real AWS EventBridge service
- Estimated time: 1-2 hours

### Option 3: Mock EventBridge with SQS
- Use SQS queues to simulate EventBridge behavior
- Limited testing but validates core messaging patterns
- Can test SQS consumer service implementation

## Recommendations

Given the EventBridge limitation in LocalStack Community Edition, **I recommend Option 2: Direct AWS Staging Deployment**.

Rationale:
- EventBridge is a critical component that needs proper testing
- AWS offers a generous free tier for EventBridge (first 1 million events/month free)
- Testing with actual AWS services provides more accurate results
- The implementation is ready for AWS deployment

---

## Files Created/Modified

1. **docker-compose.localstack.yml** - Fixed volume mounts and removed version attribute
2. **LocalStack scripts** - Ready but require AWS CLI installation
3. **EventBridge implementation** - Complete and ready for AWS deployment

---

## Commands to Proceed

### For AWS Staging Deployment:
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

# Deploy CloudFormation stack
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name qsl-eventbridge-staging \
  --template-body file://infra/aws/aws-eventbridge-messaging.template.json \
  --parameters ParameterKey=ProjectName,ParameterValue=qsl \
               ParameterKey=Environment,ParameterValue=staging

# Run application with AWS configuration
dotnet run --project QuantunSkyLink_v2.AppHost
```

## Conclusion

While LocalStack setup is complete and functional, the lack of EventBridge support in the free version prevents full local testing of the event-driven architecture. Direct deployment to AWS staging is the most practical next step.
